        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>Hello! We are Lyrical Ballad Bookstore and we are here to take you back to the ancient times where TVs or smartphone were a mere fantasy. Speaking of fantasy, that will also be included in our trip. Our goal is to help people get a better chance of having their hands on books and collecions that are frequently only found in museums or social media, or the books that were once childhood's favourite that slowly fade after time when new product appear. Come to our book store and you can discover a wide range of books of all genres, all ages since the 19th century and some rare copies that only a few thousands were made to help you visualise and somewhat experience what it was like to hold and read a book during the 19th and 20th century.</p>
        <p>But that's not all! If you come to our physical bookstore, there's awaiting for you to discover more than just books. We have designed our book store to have corners, chambers and vaults to give you the authentic feeling of being deep inside a library of the past and sometimes, in famous fantasy stories like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. Don't worry, there will be no rtap doors or puzzles for you to solve in order to enter a room. All you need to do is to follow our instruction signs and it is guaranteed that you will have an unforgetable time.</p>
